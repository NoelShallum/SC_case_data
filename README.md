# SC_case_data
Owing to a lack of any Indian case data available on the internet, I am uploading a 10,000 case corpus that includes the case name; citation number; date; Bench; appellant advocates; Respondent advocates; Issue; Decision of each case.
If anyone is interested in collaboration, you can contact me at noelshallum@gmail.com.

Note:
1. All the cases in the file are civil cases, as the data was careated primarily for my personal use.
2. While going through the data, you will notice that some cases have some fields missing, be it advocates involved in the case or the issue or decision. Unfortunately, some cases do not specify the advocates involved. While in the instance of missing issues and decisions, the results were unsatisfactory and were thus removed or were not generated by the model altogether.
